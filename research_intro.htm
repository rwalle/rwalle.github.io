<p>I use light to study the dynamics of biological tissues. I design and improve optical systems for tissue dynamics imaging, and use these systems to understand samples and drugs, including evaluating porcine embryo quality, investigating cytoskeletal drug mechanisms and relations, and predicting patient clinical outcome, all with dynamic light scattering and low-coherence interferometry. I also do a bit theory and run simulations of light propagation in biological tissues.</p>
