<p>My Ph.D. research focused on using light to study the dynamics of biological tissues. I designed and improved optical systems for tissue dynamics imaging and used these systems to understand samples and drugs. This included evaluating porcine embryo quality, investigating cytoskeletal drug mechanisms and relations, and predicting patient clinical outcome, all with dynamic light scattering and low-coherence interferometry. I also did some theoretical work and ran simulations of light propagation in biological tissues.</p>
