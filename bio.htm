<p>I am a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/" target="_blank">MathWorks</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-test.html" target="_blank">Simulink Test</a> team. </p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. degree from Purdue University in May 2020, with a major in physics. I worked with Professor <a href="https://www.physics.purdue.edu/people/faculty/nolte.php" target="_blank">David Nolte</a> on imaging dynamics of biological tissues using low-coherence light. The title of my thesis is "Doppler Fluctuation Spectroscopy in Living Tissues".</p>
<p>I like books, music, movies, art and performing arts, like to understand how things work, love creativity and admire people who create interesting things. I like computers and other elctronics, and do quite a bit of coding, including building this website. (update: am a software engineer now)</p>
