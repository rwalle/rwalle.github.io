<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in physics at Purdue University, working on imaging dynamics of biological tissues using low-coherence light.</p>
<p>I like books, music, movies, art and performing arts, like to understand how things work, love creativity and admire people who create new things. I like computers and other elctronics, and do quite a bit of coding, including building this website.</p>
